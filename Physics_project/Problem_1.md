# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation  
A projectile is launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) and an angle \( \theta \).  
The horizontal and vertical components of velocity are:  
- \( v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta \)  
- \( v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta \)  

The time of flight is given by:  
\[
t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}
\]

The range of the projectile is:  
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
\]  

## 2. Analysis of the Range  
- The range is maximum when \( \theta = 45^\circ \).  
- Increasing the initial velocity increases the range.  
- Higher gravity decreases the range.  

## 3. Practical Applications  
This concept is used in:  
- **Sports:** Soccer, basketball, golf  
- **Military:** Projectile motion in weapons  
- **Engineering:** Water fountains, firefighting  

## 4. Implementation  
We will simulate this model using Python and visualize the range vs. angle.
