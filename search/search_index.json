Derivation of Governing Equations Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s second law. We assume: - No air resistance. - Motion happens in a uniform gravitational field \\( g \\) . - The projectile is launched from the ground with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) . The motion is broken into two independent components: Horizontal Motion (constant velocity) \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion (constant acceleration due to gravity) Using kinematic equations: [ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] To find the time of flight , we set \\( y = 0 \\) (when the projectile lands): \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Now, the range (horizontal distance when \\( y = 0 \\) ) is: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t_f \\] \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\( 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\sin2\\theta \\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin2\\theta \\] This equation shows that: - The range is maximized when \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . - Doubling \\( v_0 \\) quadruples the range . - A higher gravity value reduces the range. 2. Analyzing the Range To better understand how the range changes: - If \\( v_0 \\) increases, \\( R \\) increases quadratically. - If \\( g \\) increases, \\( R \\) decreases. - If \\( \\theta \\) changes, \\( R \\) follows a sinusoidal pattern due to \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) . 3. Real-World Applications Sports : Optimizing a soccer ball\u2019s kick angle for maximum distance. Engineering : Missile and rocket trajectory planning. Environment : Studying the effect of different gravities on planets. 4. Python Simulation Now, let's code a Python simulation that plots the range as a function of launch angle . I'll generate a graph showing how the range changes with different angles. This Python script generates a graph showing how the range of a projectile changes with the launch angle. You can modify \\( v_0 \\) to see how different initial velocities affect the range. Let me know if you need any modifications or explanations! \ud83d\ude80","title":"Problem"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem","text":"Let's start with the theoretical foundation and derive the governing equations of projectile motion step by step.","title":"Problem"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-derivation-of-governing-equations","text":"Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s second law.
