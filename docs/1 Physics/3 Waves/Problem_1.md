# Problem 1
# Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

## 1. Motivation

Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap and form distinct ripple patterns on a surface. On a water surface, these interference patterns can be easily visualized when circular ripples emitted from different points interact.

Understanding how wave phase, wavelength, frequency, and source geometry influence these patterns offers deep insight into wave behavior. This experiment also demonstrates constructive interference (amplification) and destructive interference (cancellation), which are fundamental to fields like acoustics, optics, and quantum physics.

## 2. Task Description

We will study interference patterns generated by wave sources placed at the vertices of a **regular polygon** (such as a triangle, square, or pentagon). The waves are assumed to be:

- Coherent (same frequency and phase offset),
- Equal in amplitude and wavelength,
- Emitted at the same time from their respective sources.

The objective is to visualize the resulting interference patterns on the surface of water.

## 3. Mathematical Model

### 3.1. Single Source Wave Equation

The disturbance from a single point source located at \( (x_0, y_0) \) is given by:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)
$$

Where:

- \( A \): amplitude  
- \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \): wave number (λ is wavelength)  
- \( \omega = 2\pi f \): angular frequency  
- \( r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2} \): distance from source  
- \( \phi \): initial phase  
- \( t \): time  

---

### 3.2. Superposition of Waves

For \( N \) sources located at different positions, the total displacement is:

$$
\eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)
$$

This is the principle of **superposition**, where all disturbances are added point-wise.

## 4. Python Simulation Code

You can run this simulation using **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or any Python IDE with Matplotlib and NumPy installed.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulation parameters
A = 1.0                  # Amplitude
wavelength = 2.0         # Wavelength (λ)
frequency = 1.0          # Frequency (Hz)
k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength
omega = 2 * np.pi * frequency
phi = 0
t = 0                    # Time snapshot

# Grid definition
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 500)
y = np.linspace(-10, 10, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Define polygon source points (e.g., square)
def regular_polygon(n, radius=3):
    return [(radius * np.cos(2 * np.pi * i / n),
             radius * np.sin(2 * np.pi * i / n)) for i in range(n)]

# Choose number of sources (3 = triangle, 4 = square, etc.)
sources = regular_polygon(n=4)

# Calculate total wave interference
eta_sum = np.zeros_like(X)
for x0, y0 in sources:
    R = np.sqrt((X - x0)**2 + (Y - y0)**2)
    eta = A / np.sqrt(R + 1e-6) * np.cos(k * R - omega * t + phi)
    eta_sum += eta

# Plot result
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.imshow(eta_sum, extent=(-10, 10, -10, 10), cmap='RdBu', origin='lower')
plt.title("Interference Pattern from Polygonal Sources")
plt.xlabel("x-position")
plt.ylabel("y-position")
plt.colorbar(label='Wave Displacement')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
