## Projectile Motion Analysis

### 1. Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object that is launched into the air and influenced only by gravity.

We split the motion into two components:

- **Horizontal motion:** constant velocity  
  $$ x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t $$

- **Vertical motion:** uniformly accelerated motion  
  $$ y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

### 2. Simulation Example

Initial conditions:

- Initial velocity: $$ v_0 = 20\, \text{m/s} $$
- Angle: $$ \theta = 45^\circ $$
- Gravity: $$ g = 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2 $$
