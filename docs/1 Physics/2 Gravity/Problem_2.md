# Problem 2 - Escape & Cosmic Velocities Simulation

## 1. Motivation

The concept of escape velocity is crucial for understanding the conditions required to leave a celestial body's gravitational influence. Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

The gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy concepts are used to derive these velocities.

- **1st Cosmic Velocity (Orbital):**
  The minimum speed needed to stay in circular orbit around a planet:
  $$ v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $$

- **2nd Cosmic Velocity (Escape):**
  The minimum speed needed to escape the planet's gravity:
  $$ v_2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} $$

- **3rd Cosmic Velocity (Solar Escape):**
  The speed needed to escape the entire solar system, relative to the Sun:
  $$ v_3 = v_2 + v_{\text{orbital}} $$

Where:
- \(G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\)
- \(M\) is the mass of the celestial body
- \(R\) is the radius of the celestial body

The simulation compares the cosmic velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, using classical mechanics and visualizing the results with a bar chart and table.

---

## 4. Results & Discussion

- Jupiter has the highest escape velocities due to its mass.
- Earth and Mars have significantly lower values.
- The third cosmic velocity is always highest because it includes escape from the solar system.

These values help us:
- Understand satellite orbits
- Plan interplanetary missions
- Estimate launch speeds and fuel requirements

## 5. Applications in Space Exploration

- **1st velocity:** Used by satellites orbiting planets (e.g., ISS around Earth)
- **2nd velocity:** Required for rockets to leave a planet's surface
- **3rd velocity:** Required for missions beyond the solar system (e.g., Voyager probes)

This problem demonstrates the interplay of gravity, motion, and engineering, offering insight into both theoretical physics and practical aerospace applications.
