## Project Goal
- This project aims to simulate and visualize the behavior of charged particles under the influence of electric $$ \vec{E} $$ and magnetic $$ \vec{B} $$ fields using the Lorentz force law:

$$
\vec{F} = q\vec{E} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$

We'll explore real-world applications such as cyclotrons, magnetic traps, and plasma confinement devices by modeling particle trajectories using numerical techniques.

## Theoretical Foundation

The Lorentz force determines how charged particles move through electromagnetic fields. Its effects depend on:

- The magnitude and direction of the electric field $$ \vec{E} $$
- The direction and strength of the magnetic field $$ \vec{B} $$
- The particle's velocity $$ \vec{v} $$, charge $$ q $$, and mass $$ m $$

## Key Motion Behaviors

- **Circular or helical motion** in uniform $$ \vec{B} $$ fields  
- **Drift motion** in crossed $$ \vec{E} $$ and $$ \vec{B} $$ fields
